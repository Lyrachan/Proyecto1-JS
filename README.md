* This page is the first practice project from a JavaScript course
* It's interactivity is entirely oriented to manipulate buttons, adding courses to the cart list, showing their selected duplicates, removing them from the list, and emptying the list.
* For this project, DOM has been used,
* It has a lot of comments to explain what does the code do, from simple components to complex functions (all of them are in spanish btw)
